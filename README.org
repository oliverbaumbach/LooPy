* LooPy 
LooPy is a terminal program for stepwise simulation of basic LOOP/WHILE programs found in theoretical computer science. It is written purely in python.

** Requirements 
LooPy only requires Python 3.7+ and the [[https://pypi.org/project/lark/][Lark]] parser library 

** Writing LOOP Programs for LooPy 
The program syntax LooPy uses is designed to closely mirror that of the formal notation for LOOP programs. It supports the basic operations of addition, subtraction, looping and concatenation, as well as convenience operations that can be simulated by this basic set. 


#+BEGIN_SRC text
  x999 := 1;     # x<n> is variable n 
  X0   := 2;     # case insensitive    
 
  x1 := 5;       # Assign Constant
  x2 := x1;      # Assign Variabe

  x1 := x1 + 5;  # Add Constant
  x2 := x1 + x2; # Add Variable

  x1 := x1 - 5;  # Subtract Constant
  x2 := x1 - x2; # Subtract Variable

  x1 := x1 * 5;  # Multiply by Constant
  x2 := x1 * x2; # Multiply by Variable

  # Analogue: Whole Number Division, Modulo
  x1 := x1 / 2;  
  x1 := x1 % 2;

  LOOP x1 DO x1 := x1 + 5 END; # Loop

  LOOP x1 DO                   # Nested Loop
    LooP x1 dO                 # case insensitive
      x1                       
         := x1 
 * 2;
    eNd
  END

  WHILE x1 != 0 DO x1 := x1 - 1; x2 := x2 + 5 END; # While Loop 

  x0 := x2       # ! No trailing ';' for last statement

If the input program is malformed, LooPy will output an error message pointing to where the parsing failed.

On the left, there's the register column which lists all variables which have been referenced, as well as their current values. Variables which were changed during the last instruction are highlighted in bold. 

To the right of that is the program view, which shows the current program, with the currently executing statement highlighted. 

At the top right, the number of steps taken and the current instruction type are shown. At the bottom right is the current page number. LooPy will automatically switch pages as the execution moves past the border of the current page. 

You can control program execution using several keys: 

| Key |         | Behaviour                        |
|-----+---------+----------------------------------|
| n   | Next    | Step forward to next instruction |
| s   | to Step | Skip forward to n-th instruction |
| l   | to Line | Skip forward to n-th line        |
| e   | to End  | Skip forward to results screen   |

Once the program has finishd executing, LooPy will display a results screen showing the final output and variable values.
